Create a program which prints the words “This is my first program”. Save it in a file called FirstProgram.py
 
Create some Turtle graphics programs in appropriately named files. Try to draw:
    a. a rectangle
    b. two squares side by side (but not touching) – try to use exactly the same code to draw each square
    c. a triangle
    d. a yellow house with a red roof (a square with a triangle on top – don’t bother with windows and doors!)
    e. an orange hexagon with thick purple sides
    f. if you found those all really easy, try experimenting with the circle command to draw something interesting
